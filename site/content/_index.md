    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.

  heading: Why Kaldi?
  text: Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans

    profits are reinvested in their communities.
