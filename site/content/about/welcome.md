It is our pleasure to welcome you to CaseIT 2022. Hosted in collaboration with the Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University, CaseIT is the world’s premier International Undergraduate Management Information Systems Business Case Competition. CaseIT has welcomed 936 undergraduate competitors representing 48 universities from 19 different countries to compete in Vancouver since 2004.

The CaseIT 2022 Organizing Committee is comprised of top students from a multitude of faculties at Simon Fraser University and strives to work humbly, innovatively, and collaboratively. Hosting the first virtual iteration of CaseIT in 2021, the CaseIT 2022 Organizing Committee is extremely excited to provide yet another unprecedented, world-class experience to all attendees.

CaseIT has since developed from an internal competition, to one of the most prestigious undergraduate MIS case competitions in the world. Upholding the ambition, tenacity, and insatiable curiosity of our international competitors, CaseIT’s mission is to provide an unparalleled, rigorous, and engaging competition for talented business students to challenge themselves on an international stage. Not only will this talented cohort showcase their analytical skills and technology expertise, but they will be engaged in building meaningful global connections.

Welcome to CaseIT and the international audience of change-makers who are passionate about leveraging information systems to reshape the boundaries between technology and business.



Emily Kim, CaseIT 2022 Chair
