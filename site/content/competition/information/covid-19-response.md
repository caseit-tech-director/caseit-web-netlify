The international component of CaseIT is the highlight of our event, therefore, the CaseIT team is committed to producing a competition that is accessible and safe. Challenging the perspective of online competition and global connection, CaseIT 2021 will set the virtual standard as a world-renown premier undergraduate MIS case competition.

We hope that you share our excitement and will join us on this journey. We look forward to making CaseIT 2021 one of the best iterations yet!
