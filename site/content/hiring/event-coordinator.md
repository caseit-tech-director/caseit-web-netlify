This individual sees beauty in detail and is captivated by the opportunity to ensure that every line, word, and image is placed on competition materials with purpose. The Design Associate is comfortable with challenging the status quo, stimulating thoughtful discussion, and understanding that the “packaging” of the competition is equally as valuable and impactful as the competition itself.

Commitment required:

- Maintenance and development of the codebase of CaseIT and PIVOT’s official website
- Work closely with the Directors of Design to optimise the UI/UX of the current site and implement new features
- Create experimental interactive experiences using web technologies.
- Enforce proper software development practice, writing well-structured and organised code
- Optimise current development workflow
- Document best practices and guidelines to ensure a smooth transition for future iterations of CaseIT’s website

Qualifications:

- Previous experience (personal project, course, etc.) with modern web development technologies such as HTML5, SCSS & JavaScript (ReactJS)
- Previous experience working with github
- Experience with or interest in learning development using a CMS (e.g. WordPress, Netlify CMS)
- Experience in working with static site generators such as Hugo. Jekyll is preferred but not required.
- Passion for building an engaging interactive experience for a website

Successful completion of this role provides:

- Experience in leading the professional development of a website used by high-profile companies and internationally renowned schools, which can be clearly demonstrated to employers
- A portfolio that bolsters web development skills with modern development tools
- Proven ability to manage technological logistics to deliver a world-class-quality competition experience to an international audience
