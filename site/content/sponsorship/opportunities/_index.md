    CaseIT 2021 will be a new and innovative experience for both our
    international competitors and our Organizing Committee. As we transition

    technological devices to support the execution of the world’s premier
    management information systems case competition. Our competition requires a
    wide array of reliable and professional technology contributions for a
    seamless competition execution. Equipment requirements include but are not
    limited to: laptops, ethernet cords, USB ethernet adapters, microphones,
    cameras, and virtual reality equipment.
