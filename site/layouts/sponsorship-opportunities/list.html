        CaseIT 2021 will be a new and innovative experience for both our international competitors and our Organizing
        Committee.
        As we transition CaseIT to an online format, we strive to leverage the most advanced technological devices to
        support
        the execution of the world’s premier management information systems case competition. Our competition requires a
        wide
        array of reliable and professional technology contributions for a seamless competition execution. Equipment
        requirements
        include but are not limited to: laptops, ethernet cords, USB ethernet adapters, microphones, cameras, and
        virtual
        reality equipment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Technology sponsors receive acknowledgments in the form of your logo and name on the CaseIT website, social
        media, event
        program, and our online competition platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additional benefits include a tailored resume book of all CaseIT competitors and Organizing Committee,
        invitations to the synchronous CaseIT Awards Banquet, and the opportunity to judge CaseIT Preliminary and Final
        Presentations.
        Based on the value of the equipment provided, an appropriate sponsorship tier will be allocated to technology
        sponsors.
        Sponsors can further customize their contribution with our sponsorship team.
